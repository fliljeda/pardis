This is a programming exercise in which you will implement one of two algorithms in four different ways.

    Choose one of the following two algorithms:

    (a) Mergesort (b) Quicksort

    Implement a sequential version of the algorithm

    Implement a parallel version using ExecutorService. See chapter 16

    in H&S for details on how to use ExecutorService.

    Implement a parallel version using a ForkJoinPool and RecursiveAction.

    Requires a Java version 7 or later.

    Implement a parallel version using the parallel streams and lambda functions that were introduced in Java 8.

    Compare the four different implementations and explain your results.
